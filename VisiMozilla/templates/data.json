This last update, I would like to undo, if I could. Now I can't load CaringBridge, which loads just fine in Safari. Also, pages/tabs are taking way too long to load when restoring from a crash, and while they load (pause, pause pause), Firefox is inoperable. You can't even switch tabs. I usually switch to Safari and read another page while waiting for FF to reload multiple tabs.\r\nDon't know if it's a FF or Facebook problem, but after a few cut & pastes, the paste process quits working. It's been this way for several months. Drives me crazy. I'm used to dragging URLS and  text clippings to FB. FF clipboard usually quits working, no copy/no paste after a few triesâ€”it requires a complete restart to fix. \r\nSometimes I can trick FB into accepting an URL by dragging it from Safari. So, I'd venture to say it's a FF problem, not a FB one. \r\nAlso, runaway memory leakage is horrid. No way 6 tabs needs 2-3 GB of memory to run. I need to crash FF several times a day with Activity Monitor  when it hogs all my memory (&/or\r\n crash the FF plugins when it stallsâ€”buggy scripts). I've tried running FF sans ad-ons, and it still goes berzerk. Suggest that you look into FF incompatabilities with legacy Mac OS architecture (starting about 6 months ago). \r\nMBPro 3,1. 6GB memory OS 6.8 Snow Leopard. \r\nBut the hanging window / tab that won't finish loading has got to go. Or I'm done with FF. Was a time when FF was my go-to web browser. But it's so bad and buggy now, I barely use it for anything except FB.
